You previously replied to <question> with <log>, providing <code>.
But, <code> you provided has a bug to fix.
Your job is to read the <error_message> and fix error.

(Answer Rule)
1. Just answer only with pyspark code.
2. No assertation. Just provide code lines to be executed.
3. No need to import any module.
4. The number of columns in pyspark output should be {num_of_keys} as the number of keys to parse.
5. When building python code, you have to refer to <path_to_keys>, and to <parsing_sample>.
5.1. If the path is "Not found in the provided log" in <path_to_keys>, please look up to <parsing_sample>.
6. The code to provide should be built in PYTHONIC WAY at most.
7. End always with the code of 'df = log_data.rdd.map(_mapper).flatMap(lambda x: x).toDF()'
